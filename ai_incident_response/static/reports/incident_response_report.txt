**Response Actions**
-------------------

* **Block the IP address:** Block the IP address `45.33.32.156` from accessing the network to prevent further scanning activities.
* **Update firewall rules:** Review and update the firewall rules to ensure that they are configured to block slow port scans and other malicious activities.
* **Conduct a network scan:** Conduct a network scan to identify any potential vulnerabilities that may have been exploited by the attacker.
* **Monitor network traffic:** Increase monitoring of network traffic to detect any suspicious activity and prevent further attacks.
* **Gather additional evidence:** Gather additional evidence from the firewall logs and other sources to better understand the scope and impact of the incident.
* **Notify relevant teams:** Notify relevant teams, such as the security operations team, incident response team, and network operations team, to ensure that everyone is aware of the incident and can take necessary actions.
* **Review and update policies:** Review and update policies to ensure that they are aligned with the incident response plan and provide clear guidance on how to handle similar incidents in the future.

**Impact Assessment**
-------------------

The incident has a low severity score of 20 and a confidence score of 0.30, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the detection. The incident is likely a reconnaissance attempt, but further investigation is required to determine the intentions behind the scan.

**Lessons Learned & Recommendations**
-----------------------------------

* **Implement network segmentation:** Implement network segmentation to limit the spread of malware and reduce the attack surface.
* **Use intrusion detection and prevention systems:** Use intrusion detection and prevention systems to detect and prevent malicious activities, such as slow port scans.
* **Conduct vulnerability assessments:** Conduct vulnerability assessments to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities that may be exploited by attackers.
* **Implement secure protocols:** Implement secure protocols, such as SSH and HTTPS, to encrypt data in transit and prevent eavesdropping.
* **Monitor for lateral movement:** Monitor for lateral movement to detect and prevent attackers from moving laterally within the network.
* **Implement incident response plan:** Implement an incident response plan to ensure that the organization is prepared to respond to similar incidents in the future.
* **Provide security awareness training:** Provide security awareness training to employees to educate them on how to identify and report suspicious activity.

**Detection & Analysis**
----------------------

* **Detection Method:** Firewall logs
* **Evidence:** Firewall logs showing blocked scans
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** IP address 45.33.32.156, scan type: slow port scan
* **Root Cause Analysis:** The incident was caused by a slow port scan from an unknown IP address.

**Response Actions**
-------------------

* **Block the IP address:** Block the IP address '45.33.32.156' in the firewall to prevent further scanning activity.
* **Verify firewall rules:** Verify that the firewall rules are correctly configured to block the identified sensitive ports (22, 3306, 6379, 3389, 5432) and that the rules are up-to-date.
* **Monitor for similar activity:** Continuously monitor the network for similar slow port scan activity and adjust the firewall rules as necessary.
* **Update the incident response plan:** Update the incident response plan to include procedures for handling slow port scan incidents, including the steps outlined above.
* **Conduct a vulnerability assessment:** Conduct a vulnerability assessment to identify any potential vulnerabilities that may have been exploited by the attacker.
* **Implement additional security measures:** Implement additional security measures, such as intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), to detect and prevent similar incidents in the future.
* **Document the incident:** Document the incident, including the incident details, response actions, and lessons learned, to improve incident response procedures and prevent similar incidents.

**Impact Assessment**
-------------------

* **Actual or Potential Damages:** None
* **Injuries or Business Disruption:** None

**Lessons Learned & Recommendations**
-----------------------------------

* **Specific, Actionable Steps:** Implement rate limiting on the firewall to limit the number of connections from a single IP address within a given time window.
* **Use a web application firewall (WAF):** Use a WAF to detect and prevent malicious traffic, including slow port scans.
* **Conduct a security information and event management (SIEM) analysis:** Conduct a SIEM analysis to identify any potential security threats and improve incident response procedures.
* **Implement a security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) tool:** Implement a SOAR tool to automate incident response procedures and improve response times.
* **Provide user education:** Provide user education on the risks associated with slow port scans and the importance of reporting suspicious activity.

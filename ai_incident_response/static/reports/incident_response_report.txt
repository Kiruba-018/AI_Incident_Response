### Lessons Learned & Recommendations
--------------------------------------

### Incident Response Recommendations

* Block the IP address `45.33.32.156` from accessing the network to prevent further scanning activities.
* Update firewall rules to ensure that the blocked ports (21, 22, 23, 25, and 80) are properly configured to block incoming traffic.
* Conduct a network scan to identify any potential vulnerabilities or open ports that may have been exploited by the attacker.
* Review system logs to identify any potential indicators of compromise (IOCs) or suspicious activity related to the IP address `45.33.32.156`.
* Implement rate limiting on the firewall to prevent similar slow port scan attacks in the future.
* Update security policies to include rules that block slow port scan traffic and provide guidance on how to handle similar incidents in the future.

### MITRE ATT&CK Framework Recommendations

* Analyze network traffic to identify any potential indicators of lateral movement or data exfiltration.
* Conduct a vulnerability assessment to identify any potential vulnerabilities that may have been exploited by the attacker.
* Implement security controls such as intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and prevent similar attacks in the future.
* Provide training and awareness to employees on how to identify and report suspicious activity related to slow port scan attacks.

### Additional Recommendations

* Document the incident response process and lessons learned to improve incident response procedures in the future.
* Review and update the incident response plan to ensure that it includes procedures for handling slow port scan attacks.

**Lessons Learned & Recommendations**
-----------------------------------

### Specific, Actionable Steps

* Block the IP address `45.33.32.156` from accessing the network to prevent further scanning activity.
* Investigate the source of the scan, including the potential malicious actor or compromised system.
* Update firewall rules to ensure that they are configured to block slow port scans and other suspicious activity.
* Conduct a network scan to identify any potential vulnerabilities or open ports that may have been exploited by the malicious actor.
* Review system logs to identify any potential indicators of compromise (IOCs) or suspicious activity.
* Notify relevant teams to ensure that they are aware of the incident and can take necessary actions.

### Recommended Actions from MITRE ATT&CK Framework

* Implement a network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) to detect and prevent slow port scans and other suspicious activity.
* Implement a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) to detect and prevent malicious activity on individual hosts.
* Conduct regular vulnerability assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors.
* Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to protect web applications from common web attacks, including slow port scans.
* Implement a security information and event management (SIEM) system to collect and analyze log data from various sources to identify potential security threats.

### Additional Recommendations

* Review and update incident response policies to ensure that they are aligned with the latest security best practices and regulations.
* Conduct regular security awareness training to educate employees on the latest security threats and best practices.
* Implement a security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) system to automate and streamline incident response processes, reducing the time and effort required to respond to security incidents.
